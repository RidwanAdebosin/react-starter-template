## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Template

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RidwanAdebosin/react-starter-template.git
cd react-starter-template
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Using npm
npm install

# Using pnpm
pnpm install

# Using yarn
yarn install
```

### 3. Add Environment Variables

```bash
# Create a .env file in the root of the project:
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-api.com
```

### 4. Start the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev

# or

pnpm run dev

# or

yarn dev
```

### Simple-git-hooks

A git hook is a command or script that is going to be run every time you perform a git action.
Simple-git-hooks in this case helps to automate code formatting pre-commit, and linting pre-push.
This helps to make sure you don't push broken code to your remote repository, ensuring a clean codebase and error catching before push.

#### Initiate simple-git-hooks

To enable `simple-git-hooks` which is already installed and set up, simply run the following in your command line:

```bash
# Using npm
npx simple-git-hooks

# Using pnpm
pnpm dlx simple-git-hooks

# Using yarn
yarn simple-git-hooks
```

#### Disable simple-git-hooks

Well, everyone loves a clean and error-free codebase, so you should actually enable simple-git-hooks!
But if you want to disable it, simply remove node_modules folders and re-install npm/pnpm/yarn.

```bash
rm -rf .idea node_modules

# and then

npm install
# or
pnpm install
# or
yarn install
```
